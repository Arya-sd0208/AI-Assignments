Transport:
1) Self driving cars:
   Data:
* Sensor Data: 3D mapping of the environment.
               Radar: Detects objects, speed, and distance.
* GPS & Mapping Data: (HD) maps for precise navigation.
                       Real-time GPS for positioning and route optimization.
* Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication: Communication with traffic lights, road 
   infrastructure, and other vehicles for better coordination.
* A I & M L Data: Data from millions of driving hours to train models on behavior prediction.
                   Neural networks for decision-making in dynamic environments.
* Traffic & Weather Data: Live updates to adjust driving behavior accordingly.

  Problem Statement:
* The goal of self-driving cars is to develop autonomous vehicles (AVs) that can navigate 
  without human intervention using AI, sensors, and real-time data processing.
* Challenges include safety, regulatory compliance, unpredictable human behavior, and adapting 
  to complex road conditions.

2) Enhanced Driving Experience:
   Data:
* Real-time Traffic Data – GPS, road sensors, and congestion reports.
* Driver Behavior Data – Speed patterns, braking habits, and fatigue detection.
* Vehicle Diagnostics – Engine performance, tire pressure, and fuel efficiency.
* Weather & Road Conditions – External factors affecting safety.
* User Preferences – Seat positioning, climate control, and infotainment choices

  Problem Statement:
* Traffic Congestion – Leads to stress and increased travel time.
* Driver Fatigue – Long drives cause exhaustion, reducing reaction time.
* Road Safety – Accidents due to distracted driving and human errors.
* Navigation Issues – Inefficient routing and lack of real-time updates.
* Environmental Impact – High fuel consumption and emissions.
* Lack of Personalization – Generic driving settings without driver preferences.

3) Car Monitoring System:
   Data:
 * Vehicle Parameters: Speed, RPM, engine temperature, fuel level, battery health.
 * GPS & Location Data: Real-time tracking, geofencing, route history.
 * Sensor Data: Tire pressure, brake condition, acceleration, collision detection.
 * Driver Behavior: Harsh braking, rapid acceleration, idle time, drowsiness detection.
 * External Conditions: Weather, road conditions, traffic patterns.

   Problem Statement:
* Traditional car monitoring lacks real-time insights, leading to unexpected breakdowns, 
  inefficient fuel use, and security issues.
* Need for an intelligent system to track vehicle health, location, and driver behavior in 
  real- time.

 4)  Enhancing Passenger Safety:
     Data:
* Accident Rates: Increase in road accidents (1.3M deaths/year globally), rail derailments, and 
                  aviation incidents.
* Crime in Public Transport: Rising cases of theft, harassment, and vandalism.
* Infrastructure Gaps: Poor lighting, lack of emergency exits, and outdated safety mechanisms.
* Passenger Awareness: Lack of safety education among commuters.

    Problem Statement:
* Ensuring the safety of passengers in various modes of transportation (air, rail, road, and 
  water) is crucial due to increasing incidents of accidents, crime, and operational failures. * The goal is to implement advanced technologies, policies, and infrastructure improvements 
  to minimize risks and enhance overall security.
